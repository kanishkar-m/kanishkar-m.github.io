# TUCTF Forensics Writeup

## **Challenge 1: Mystery Presentation**
[Challenge Download Link](https://github.com/nsr3953/tuctf24-public/tree/main/forensics/mystery-presentation/dist)

### **Challenge Description**
- We recently received an absolutely **non-sensical presentation** from a confidential informant.A note was attached, stating: "The truth hurts boomers, but it's what on the inside that counts <3".We can't make sense of it, but it must be important! Can you help us out?

---

### **Solution**

- We are provided with a `.pptx` file and need to uncover the **hidden flag**.  

1. **Identify File Type:**  
   - First, determine the file type using the `file` command:  

     ```bash
     file quantum_propulsion_via_dank_memes.pptx 
     quantum_propulsion_via_dank_memes.pptx: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=deflate
     ```
   - This confirms that the PowerPoint file is essentially a **ZIP archive**.

2. **Extract Contents:**  
   - Running the `strings` command on the **.pptx** file revealed a **hidden 7z file**.  

   ![Extracting 7z file](/assets/img/tuctf_24/Screenshot%202025-01-26%20104724.png)  

   - I extracted the `secret_data.7z` file from the PowerPoint ZIP archive.

3. **Extract the 7z File:**  
   - Using the following command, I extracted the contents from the **7z archive**:

     ```bash
     7z x secret_data.7z
     ```

   - This extraction revealed a **flag.txt** file.

4. **Reveal the Flag:**  
   - Using `cat`, I displayed the contents of `flag.txt`:  

     ```bash
     cat flag.txt              
     TUCTF{p01yg10+_fi1e5_hiddin9_in_p1@in_5i9h+} 
     ```

   - Polyglot files are pretty cool! Here are some more advanced ones:

## **Challenge 2: Packet Detective**
[Challenge Download Link](https://github.com/nsr3953/tuctf24-public/tree/main/forensics/Packet-Detective)

### **Challenge Description**
- You are a security analyst given a **PCAP file** containing network traffic. Hidden among these packets is a **secret flag** that was transmitted. Your task is to analyze the PCAP file, filter out common traffic, and pinpoint the packet carrying the hidden flag.  

---

### **Solution**

- We are given a `.pcap` file.  
- I opened the given **traffic_analysis.pcap** file in **Wireshark**.  
- Navigated to:  

  ```
  Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy
  ```

- From the analysis, I observed that **HTTP traffic** was present.  

  ![Protocol Hierarchy Statistics](/assets/img/tuctf_24/Screenshot%202025-01-26%20114413.png)  

- Since HTTP traffic often includes plaintext data, I applied the following filter to isolate relevant packets:  

  ```
  data
  ```

- By examining the **last data packet**, I found the flag embedded within the transmitted content.

## **Challenge 3: Bunker**
[Challenge Download Link](https://github.com/nsr3953/tuctf24-public/blob/main/forensics/bunker/dist/Bunker.7z)
### **Challenge Description**
- **[REPORT]** Mail notification received from an access point.  
  - **Subject:** `YoRHa_CLASSIFIED_12u3440029491`  
  - **Origin:** `Bunker`  

- **Query:** What is the nature of this transmission?  
- **Hypothesis:** A deeper analysis of the enclosed files may yield more information.  
- **Proposal:** The scanner-type unit is advised to perform **standard scanning procedures** on the data for further analysis.  
- **Warning:** Data appears **classified**. Any unauthorized actions could be considered **treason**. Proceed in secrecy.  

---

### **Solution**
We are given with a .7z file

1. **Extract the Archive Contents**  
   - Extract the `.7z` file using `7z`:

     ```bash
     7z x Bunker.7z
     ```

   - This reveals **two files**:  
     - `Bunker_DB`: **Keepass password database** (KDBX format)  
     - `Bunker_DMP`: **MiniDump crash report**  

   - Confirming file types using the `file` command:

     ```bash
     file Bunker_DB Bunker_DMP
     ```

     Output:
     ```
     Bunker_DB: Keepass password database 2.x KDBX
     Bunker_DMP: MiniDump crash report, 17 streams, Sun Nov 17 22:47:09 2024, 0x621826 type
     ```

2. **Memory Dump Analysis**  
   - Open `Bunker_DMP` in **Ghidra**.  
   - During our investigation, we identified **keepass.exe** running in memory.  
     ![keepass.exe](/assets/img/tuctf_24/Screenshot%202025-01-28%20182423.png)  

3. **Exploring KeePass Vulnerabilities**  
   - Researching KeePass vulnerabilities, we found **CVE-2023-32784**, which allows extracting the **master password** from memory dumps.

   - We cloned the following **PoC exploit** from GitHub:

     ```
     https://github.com/vdohney/keepass-password-dumper
     ```

4. **Extracting the KeePass Master Password**  
   - Running the PoC tool on the memory dump revealed the master password:  

     ![Running the PoC Tool](/assets/img/tuctf_24/Screenshot%202025-01-28%20183410.png)  

     ```
     gL0Ry_2_M4nk1Nd!_Y0RH4
     ```

5. **Unlocking the KeePass Database**  
   - Installed **KeePassXC** on Kali and used the extracted password to unlock the database:

     ![Unlocking KeePass Database](/assets/img/tuctf_24/Screenshot%202025-01-28%20183806.png)  

6. **Exploring the KeePass Entries**  
   - After unlocking the database, we explored its contents:

     ![Exploring KeePass Entries](/assets/img/tuctf_24/Screenshot%202025-01-28%20184100.png)  

   - Navigating to `Recycle Bin → Bunker → backdoor_pw -> History`, we found the **hidden flag** at first entry field at password section :
     ![history](/assets/img/tuctf_24/Screenshot%202025-01-29%20183240.png)

     ![Flag Found](/assets/img/tuctf_24/Screenshot%202025-01-28%20183926.png)
